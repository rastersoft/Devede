<h2>The main interface</h2>

<p>After choosing the kind of disk you want, you will see the main interface:</p>

<p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="main.jpg" /><br/><h5>Main interface for DVD discs</h5></div></p>

<p>A DVD is divided in <b>Titles</b> and <b>Files</b>. Each title is a film on its own, and,
when played, you have to choose the one you want to see. Into each title you can add as many files as
you want, and cut them in chapters to allow an easy search. But remember that a DVD can contain up to 61 files,
and a VideoCD, SuperVCD or CVD up to 99 files.</p>

<p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="main2.jpg" /><br/><h5>Main interface for VCD/SVCD/CVD discs</h5></div></p>

<p>In VideoCDs, Super VideoCDs and CVDs there's no title concept, so that frame won't be visible when you
choose to create one of them.</p>

<h3>Main window properties</h3>

<p>In the DVD window screenshot we can see that there are two titles, and title two has two files.
The files in a title will be played one after another, like a single film. So if you only want to
create a DVD with one single film from multiple files, you have to put all of them in a single title. Your
player will merge all in a single film.</p>

<p>The <b>File info</b> box contains all the information about the selected file: the final audio an video
rate, original and final size, FPS and length in seconds. It has the estimated size in Mbytes, but have in mind
that is an estimation, so the final size can be lower (but never higher).</p>

<p>The <b>Disk usage</b> bar shows the percentage of the disk currently used. You can occupy more than the
100% because it's based in an estimation, so the final size can (and probably will) be lower than the
espected, but never higher (see the <a href="faq.html">FAQ</a> for details). You can choose the CD/DVD size too.
Have in mind another thing: a 700MB CD can contain 80 minutes of compressed audio/video, which, at 1152 kbps are
about 800MB. This means that, when the media is a CD, you MUST use the bar to know how many disc space you are
using, and not the estimated size of the files, because you can put up to 800MB of compressed video in a 700MB
CD, or about 720MB in a 650MB CD.</p>

<p>Under the bar is the <b>Adjust disk usage</b> button. Clicking on it will adjust the video rate in each video
in order to use the 100% of the disk. To do so, DeVeDe takes in account the final resolution and the length,
giving more bits per second to the videos with a higher resolution, but always in a proportional way. Remember
that you should always click again the <b>Adjust disk usage</b> button after changing the final resolution,
adding or removing subtitles, adding or removing titles, or, in general, before creating your disk,
in order to assign a good video bit rate to each film. Remember that changing the soundtrack used in the menus
will change the disk usage too.</p>

<p>The <b>Default format</b> sets the format used by default in your disk. It's used to create the menus
and each time you add a video file. But, as we will see in a moment, you can use a different format in some
videos if you want, having PAL and NTSC videos mixed in the same disk.</p>

<p>The <b>Preview menu</b> button allows you to see how will be the DVD menus. If you dislike it, you can
change their properties (background picture, text colors, title...) with the <b>Menu properties</b> button. This will be
explained with more detail in the section <a href="menu.html">Creating the DVD menu</a>. You can choose if you
want or not a menu in your disk checking or unchecking the <b>Create a menu with the titles</b> checkbox.</p>

<p>Finally, there is an expander which hiddes the advanced options. If you expand it, you will see this:</p>

<p><div style="text-align: center"><img src="main3.jpg" /><br/><h5>Main interface for DVD discs with advanced
options expanded.</h5></div></p>

<p>Here, the <b>Action</b> block allows you to choose what do you want to create. The first option,<b>Only
convert film files to compliant MPEG files</b> takes each file and converts it to a DVD-compliant MPEG-PS
file, or to VCD, SVCD or CVD-compliant MPEG-PS. You can choose a generic name, being the default name "movie",
so the files will have names like <b>movie_XX_YY.mpg</b>, being XX the title, and YY the file position
into the title. An example: if you have two titles, and two files in the first title and three files at
the second title, you will get five files: movie_01_01.mpg, movie_01_02.mpg, movie_02_01.mpg,
movie_02_02.mpg and movie_02_03.mpg. This option is specially usefull when you want to create DVD menus
with other program like <a href="http://dvdstyler.sourceforge.net/">DVD Styler</a>,
<a href="http://qdvdauthor.sourceforge.net/">Q DVD Author</a> or
<a href="http://polidori.sourceforge.net/">PoliDori</a>. Of course, with VCD, SVCD or CVD, the title
number will be always "01".</p>

<p>The second option, <b>Create disk structure</b>, is visible only when you create a DVD. It creates the
MPEG files and then uses DVDAuthor to create the DVD tree structure. After that, it erases the MPEG files (unless
you unckeck the <b>Erase temporary files</b> button). You can use this option to create the folder and files
for a DVD and use your own DVD recording program to create the ISO image and burn it into a DVD.</p>

<p>The third option, (second if you are creating a VCD, SVCD or CVD), <b>Create an ISO or BIN/CUE image,
ready to burn to a disk</b>, converts the files to MPEG, creates the DVD tree if needed and, using
<b>MKISOFS</b>, creates the ISO file, erasing then the MPEG and DVD tree to free disk space. With CD media,
it converts the files to MPEG and uses <b>VCDImager</b> to create a BIN/CUE image, ready to be burned
to a CD. Use this option to create a disk image ready to be burned to a CD/DVD with a program like
<a href="http://gnomebaker.sourceforge.net/">GnomeBaker</a> or <a href="http://www.k3b.org">K3b</a>, or directly
from the Gnome Desktop.</p>

<p>These options will be unavailable when creating DIVX files, because there you will create only files, not
disk images.</p>

<p>The next block, <b>options</b>, starts with <b>Erase temporary files</b>, which allows to choose if you want
DeVeDe to erase the temporary files as soon as they are needed no more. Selecting it, DeVeDe will need
only about twice the final disk space, but if you don't mark it, you will need about three times the final
disk space, but you will have all the temporary files to analize them.</p>
<p>The next option, <b>Use optimizations for multicore CPUs</b>, when marked, makes Mencoder to use several
threads to convert the videos, thus getting advantage of multicore CPUs to run faster.</p>
